steps <- activity %>% select(steps, date) %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(steps_per_day = sum(steps))

hist(steps$steps_per_day, main = "Total Number of Steps Taken per Day", xlab = "Steps Per Day", ylab = "Interval", col = "light blue")
 
mean_dailysteps <- mean(steps$steps_per_day, na.rm = TRUE)

## [1] 10766.19
median_dailysteps <- median(steps$steps_per_day, na.rm = TRUE)
median_dailysteps
## [1] 10765
Answer: The mean of the total number of steps taken per day is equal to 10766.19 The median of the total number of steps taken per day is equal to 10765
What is the average daily activity pattern?
library(ggplot2)

average <- group_by(activity, interval) %>% summarise(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(average, aes(x = interval, y = average_steps, type = "l")) + geom_line(color = "blue") + 
  ggtitle("Average Number of Steps by Interval") + xlab("Interval") + ylab("Average Steps across All Days")
 
interval_max_steps <- filter(average, average_steps == max(average$average_steps))
interval_max_steps
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   interval average_steps
##      <int>         <dbl>
## 1      835          206.
Answer: interval 835 contains the maximum number of steps. The person is very active at around 2:00pm (to be accurate at 1:55pm)

steps_new <- activity_new %>% select(steps, date) %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(steps_per_day_new = sum(steps))

hist(steps_new$steps_per_day_new, main = "Total Number of Steps Taken per Day (New Dataset)", xlab = "Steps Per Day (New)", ylab = "Interval", col = "blue")

median_dailysteps_new <- median(steps_new$steps_per_day_new, na.rm = TRUE)
median_dailysteps_new
## [1] 10766.19
Answer: There are 2304 missing value in total in the dataset The mean of the total number of steps taken per day didnâ€™t change after imputing, still equal to 10766.19 The median of the total number of steps taken per day increased slightly to 10766.19 from 10765, after imputing
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
wkd <- weekdays(as.Date(strptime(activity_new$date, format =  "%Y-%m-%d")))
wkd <- as.factor(wkd)

activity_by_date <- cbind(activity_new, wkd)

levels(activity_by_date$wkd) <- list(weekday = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"), 
                                     weekend = c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
levels(activity_by_date$wkd)
## [1] "weekday" "weekend"
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
with(activity_by_date[activity_by_date$wkd == "weekday", ], plot(aggregate(steps ~ interval, FUN = mean), type = "l", main = "Activity in Weekdays"))
with(activity_by_date[activity_by_date$wkd == "weekend", ], plot(aggregate(steps ~ interval, FUN = mean), type = "l", main = "Activity in Weekends"))
 
Answer: The person is more activate in weekends than in weekdays
